I am 21 years old from New York City. At St. Lawrence University, I am majoring in Computer Science with growing interest in cloud services. I used 
to play varsity baseball back in high school. My go-to foods are fried dumplings, pizza, sushi, and burgers.

## My Hobbies
One of my hobbies is watching UFC, whcih stemmed from taking Brazilian JiuJitsu classes over the summer. Speaking of summer, 
I was also a DJ for a little while, hyping up a function. I also love to play basketball for fun even though it gets competitive. 
Additionally, going to the gym allows me to gain clarity and improve my health. Lastly, I like exploring food places around the city.
